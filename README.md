# PythonCourseS2
My path in the "Python Generation course: a course for advanced" 

In this course I repeated the following topics: basic language constructs,
bool / NoneType, lists, nested lists, matrices, tuples, sets, dictionaries,
random and string, decimal, fraction, complex, turtle, functions, working with various file types
